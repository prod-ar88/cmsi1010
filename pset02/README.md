# Pset02

This directory includes data_structures_cardio.py & mad_libs.py. 

data_structures_cardio.py is a fair-leveled assignment to write functions and make sure they all pass the tests.
This included checking tuples and its elements, sub/supersets, dictionaries, lists, and strings.

mad_libs.py is a complicated but fun project to code a game using different words inside 10 templates.
Yes and no responses support English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, Dutch, and Romanian!
Note: I used Google and SOME AI assistance to guide me on some sections that I had no clue on what to write.
